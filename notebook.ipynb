This required very little work for the team.\n\n- Call: Customers in this group were called by a member of the sales team. On average members of the team were on the phone for around thirty minutes per customer.\n\n- Email and call: Customers in this group were first sent the product information email, then called a week later by the sales team to talk about their needs and how this new product may support their work.

It is also multimodal as evidence by the five peaks in the first violin plot. This suggests that there are different groups of customers with varying levels of revenue.\n\nWhen looking at the revenue by sales method, we can see that Email + Call has the largest spread and median among the three methods. This could indicate that this method is more effective in reaching high-revenue customers. However, it also has the largest interquartile range (IQR) of $35.34, which means that there is a wide range of revenue outcomes for this method.\n\nOn the other hand, Call has the smallest spread and median among the three methods, with an IQR of $11.21. This suggests that while it may not be as effective in reaching high-revenue customers, it may be more consistent in generating revenue.\n\nEmail falls in between the other two methods, with a smaller spread and median than Email + Call, but a larger spread and median than Call. Its IQR is $17.29.\n\nOverall, these insights can help inform business decisions around sales strategies and resource allocation. For example, if the goal is to target high-revenue customers, the Email + Call method may be more effective, but if consistency in revenue generation is a priority, the Call method may be a better choice.","metadata":{},"id":"eaf9b8c1-d9f3-457e-bba3-218a7193f2e8","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![image](image4.png)\n\n![image](image5.png)\n\n![image](image6.png)\n\nFrom the bar plots above, we can infer the following:\n\nThe most common sales method is \"Email\", followed by \"Call\" and \"Email + Call\".\nThe sales method with the highest total revenue is \"Email\", followed by \"Email + Call\" and \"Call\".\nThe sales method with the highest average revenue per sale is \"Email + Call\", followed by \"Email\" and \"Call\".\nThe Email + Call brings more money on average then the other methods.

Here are the reasons for this recommendation:\n\nHighest Average Revenue: The Email + Call method consistently generates the highest average revenue per customer throughout the six weeks.

While there may be fluctuations in average revenue between weeks, the overall trend shows an increasing average revenue per customer. This suggests that this approach has the potential for continued success in generating revenue.\n\nCompetitive Advantage: The Email + Call method also exhibits a significant difference in average revenue per customer compared to the other methods, particularly in weeks 4, 5, and 6. This indicates that it has a competitive advantage in terms of generating higher revenue per customer compared to the alternatives.\n\nConsidering these factors, the Email + Call method appears to be the most effective and promising approach for generating revenue.
